## Overview

## How does this work?
Coming soon.


## Installation
This is not available on the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-Ons. Instead, you'll have to manually install it yourself.

### Chrome
1. Download all of these files by clicking **Clone or Download**, a green button near the right of the page. Choose "Download ZIP."
2. Unzip the folder into a new folder on your computer. Name it whatever you want, but "cc-ce-queue" is a reasonable idea.
3. In Chrome, go to the top right and click on the 3-dots menu. Go to **More tools > Extensions**.
4. Check the **Developer Mode** checkbox on that page.
5. Click the **Load unpacked extension...** button on that page.
6. Select the folder you just created.
7. Make sure the **Enabled** checkbox is checked.

### Firefox
1. Download all of these files by clicking **Clone or Download**, a green button near the right of the page. Choose "Download ZIP."
2. Unzip the folder into a new folder on your computer. Name it whatever you want, but "cc-ce-queue" is a reasonable idea.
3. In Firefox, go to the top right and click on the 3-lines menu. Click **Add-ons**.
4. Check the Settings icon in the top-right of the Add-ons page, then choose **Debug Add-ons**.
5. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** ...
7. Find the folder you just downloaded, and select the `manifest.json` file to upload.

The extension should now run on the Light CE.
